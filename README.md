# School

A simple TI-BASIC game that i made in middle school years ago. The original game can be found on [ticalc.org](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/218/21871.html). It was a menu-based RPG Ã  la [Drug Wars](http://tistory.wikidot.com/drugwars) and was filled with inside jokes/references from things at our school.

This document is intended to document the original, the final game will fill in a lot of gaps to make it more playable as a graphical game, adding more weapons and enemy types and perhaps making small changes to the storyline to be more congruent (and perhaps a bit more palatable).

# Format

The main character goes through a series of levels fighting "bad guys/gals" in order to upgrade health and weapons and eventually defeat the boss of each level. Enemies get progressively stronger as you go through.

Bosses have a short comic dialog before the fight.


# Black Market / Store

All items were purchased from the black market, which served as the main way to upgrade your health and weapons. You could buy multiple items at once as there was a number telling you how many of an item you could afford.

# Fights

Fights are automated, the player just presses the [2nd] button to start each round. When either the player or the enemy's health reaches zero, the fight ends.

## Attacking
Your attack is calculated as a random number between ATK and ATK - 24. The player always attacks first. The same formula is used for enemy attacks.

## Winning
If the enemy was a boss, you get their full amount of money. Otherwise, you get a random amount of the enemy's money, from (MAX GOLD - 50) to MAX GOLD.

### Critical Kills
You have a 1 in 10 chance of getting a critical kill.

#### Text
"You hurt 'em"  
"You took all of their money and left them lying there..."
